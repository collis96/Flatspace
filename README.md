This project aims to simulate orbital mechanics in a 2-Dimensional plane.

Live Demo link: [Insert here]

To-do list:

* ~~Realise a design pattern~~
* ~~Implement a game loop~~
* ~~Draw an object on the screen~~
* Handle the movement of objects (physics of the program)
  * ~~Calculate the orbital elements~~
  * Plot orbit trajectory from the orbital elements
  * Render object moving along the orbit plot
* Allow a user to change object properties (mass, size, colour, speed direction)
* Handle object collisions
* think of anything else?
